Everyone seems to know about the serene beauty of Lake Atitlan, the old-world charm of Antigua and the exotic ruins of Tikal. And, you should certainly visit those places; they are all well worth the journey. But, have you ever had the desire to explore a different side of Guatemala; something off the beaten path?

Near the eastern border with Mexico, **Nenton** is riddled with more than 200 [cenotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote), or sinkholes, formed centuries ago by collapsing cave systems. Today, many of these holes have plants growing inside of them, and a few boast a perfect cylindrical shape and house entire forests within! There are even a series of small lakes in some of the sinkholes. These things are seriously huge, and unlike anything you have ever seen!

Photos don't capture how beautiful the cenotes are. I had an amazing time swimming there. The trip to get there is definitely off the beaten path, but it is truly a magical place that I feel lucky to have visited!

Besides the cenotes, you will feel amazed by adding these other gems to your next Guatemalan vacation.
